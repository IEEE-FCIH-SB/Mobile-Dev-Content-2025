Refactor the existing supermarket program in Dart to allow users to manage the inventory dynamically through console-based user input. The program should allow users to add, update, remove, and view items in the inventory instead of relying on a predefined list.

Requirements:
1. User Interaction for Inventory Management
Implement a menu-driven system where users can choose from the following options:
  Add a new item → Enter product name, price, and quantity.
  Update an existing item → Modify the price or quantity of an item.
  Remove an item → Delete an item from the inventory.
  Display inventory → Show all items with their details.
Exit the program.
2. Data Storage & Management
  Use a Map or List to store inventory items. Each item should include:
     Name (unique identifier).
     Price (double).
     Quantity (integer).
Ensure each product is uniquely identified and prevent duplicate entries.
3. Validation & Error Handling
   Ensure valid input (e.g., non-negative price and quantity).
   Prevent adding duplicate names unless updating an existing product.
   Handle cases where users attempt to update or remove non-existing items.
   Provide clear error messages when invalid operations are performed.
4. Persistent Inventory (Optional)
Implement file handling (file management) to save and load inventory data between program runs.
